<p> I am a complete beginner to this, but it's something that I have wanted to do for such a long time so I thought I had better start somewhere. I have been inspired by <a href="http://sebleedelisle.com/training/" target="_blank">Seb Lee-Delisle</a> and his <a href="http://sebleedelisle.com/2011/04/creativejs-video-from-london-web-standards/" target="_blank">short presentation at London Web Standards</a>. I would love to go to one of his training courses, but in the
meantime there&rsquo;s no reason not to give it a go.</p>
<p> This is the beginning of my experimentation with particles. I've created a couple of very basic particles explosions using canvas.  </p>
