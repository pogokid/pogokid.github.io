Over the last couple of days for some reason I decided to use earphones rather than
my usual headphones when I needed to concentrate and wanted to listen to some music.

It is such a small subtle change but I've been amazed at how it has released more
creativity and free thinking. Why is that?

I've been discussing this with [Stuart Harris](https://twitter.com/stuarte) who
works from my office as a health, wellness and performance coach. An interesting guy
to have these kinds of discussions with.

He suggested that our attention capability is activated by a change. The brain
picks up on things that are unexpected or different visually, auditory
or in the temperature around us. When we get used to the norm we end up paying
attention to what is different instead.

This simple change has probably brought out different aspects of the music I listen
to regularly. This on one level could be distracting because it could be too
stimulating. However it seems that instead it is just stimulating enough that it
has improved my "awakeness" and in turn given me focus.

Throughout my life I have naturally tended to make small changes regularly,
maybe this was instilled at an early age when I moved about so much, and between different
cultures when I lived in rural Philippines and then in Manilla and in an American
boarding school. So although I have put down more roots as I have grown older it
seems that subconsciously I have noticed benefits from small changes and naturally
I enjoy making them.

In my article [Five key principles for better web development](http://www.creativebloq.com/principles-web-development-8134177)
in .net online magazine I touched on the lifecycle of creativity. I was exploring
the idea that creations have to die for creativity to survive. It feels like
at an even more micro level life-cycles in behaviours are also really beneficial.

This article on [Why do small changes have a big impact](http://thesmallchangeproject.com/2014/04/why-do-small-changes-have-big-impact/)
has some reasons which resonate with me and they are:

 - You're used to doing so many things without any attention in the first place
 - You haven't taken the time to compare what *is* working verses what *isn't*
 - Because *everyting* in your life is connected!

Making these small changes, seeing a life-cycle in many areas of your life means
that you are analysing without really knowing it, you realise what things need
your attention when you stop doing them.

Everything is connected.
