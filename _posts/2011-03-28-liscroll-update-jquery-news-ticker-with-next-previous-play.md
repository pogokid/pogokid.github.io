There was an [issue raised on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5338734/jquery-liscroll-text-width-problem/) for the liScroll news ticker which I updated a while back now. So I delved in to the code and made a few modifications and the fix.

I have moved the project and code over to GitHub. You can view the project at <http://github.com/davetayls/jquery.liScroll>

Credit back to [Gian Carlo Mingati](http://www.gcmingati.net/wordpress/wp-content/lab/jquery/newsticker/jq-liscroll/scrollanimate.html) for the original liScroll.
