It was great to hear that the new responsive [Econsultancy website](https://econsultancy.com/)
went live at the end of last year. I had a great time working with their
team who were all top technical and creative guys.

I particularly enjoyed their use of the [Github workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
 which was great at ironing out issues and sharing the code knowledge.

The ui tech stack for this project included Sass with Inuit, Angular and we built
 a lot of the initial mockups using the Assemble static site generator.
