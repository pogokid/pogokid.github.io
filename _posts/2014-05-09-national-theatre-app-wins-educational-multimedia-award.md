It was exciting to find out last week that the [National Theatre App](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/50-years-national-theatre/id720763482?mt=8) I built with [Play Nicely](http://playnicely.com) has won the [Educational Multimedia Award](http://bufvc.ac.uk/events/learningonscreen/winners-2014) from the [British Universities Film & Video Council](http://bufvc.ac.uk/).

Here are a couple of screenshots from the app which was built with HTML5, Backbone.js and a Cordova native wrapper.
