Last night was the yearly [Sitecore site of the year](http://www.sitecore.net/Customers/SiteOfTheYear.aspx) awards and our team at [Aqueduct](http://aqueduct.co.uk) won our category for the [FA Just Play](http://justplay.thefa.com) website. Here is [Dan](http://twitter.com/dan_rachele) the back-end lead with Nick Meldrum

Needless to say we're well chuffed, it was a great project and great to be working with [The FA](http://thefa.com)
