I am trying to put together some thoughts on testing the various aspects of the Front-End to content based web sites (ie not web apps). I thought I would document the journey.

This is something I have been thinking about for some time. There are various aspects to the front-end architecture which I'd like to break down and think about individually.

Areas of Web Testing
---------------------

Here are the areas which I think I'll look at more closely.

*    Front-End Code Validation
     This is making sure that the code being created adheres to a decided set of standards.

*    Html Validation (Html Validator)
     Use a custom DTD so that you can specify decided upon exceptions to the rules:
     https://github.com/NeilCrosby/frontend-test-suite/tree/master/dtd
*    CSS Validation (CSS Validator)
*    JavaScript Validation (jsLint)
*    Check for broken links

*   Functional Testing

    *    User journeys

*   Link Checking
*   Unit testing
*   Test Coverage

Here are a few sites on an initial search which I'm going to glean some thoughts from.
