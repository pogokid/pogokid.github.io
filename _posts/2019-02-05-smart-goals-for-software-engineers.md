One of the big challenges I have found going into a management role is finding ways to help the people in my team develop their skills and their career.

I have done some research and have collated some of my favourite examples.

## Design Goals

I want all of these goals to conform to the SMART criteria.

### S - Specific

These goals must be clear and well defined. We all need to understand when the goal is achieved.

### M - Measurable

I need to be able to pull some sort of metric from the goal which is not ambiguous.

### A - Agreed Upon

I want to remain in-line with our agile priciples of personal ownership and that should include goals.

### R - Realistic

Our primary aim is to see this person succeed! So the goal must be achievable in the allotted time.

### T - Time Based

There must be a point in time when we can review and assess whether this goal has been completed.

## Goal Categories
