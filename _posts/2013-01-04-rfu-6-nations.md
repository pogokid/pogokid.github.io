## Facelift
[The RFU](http://www.rfu.com) revisited the WE ARE campaign and brought a lighter face lift for the [RBS 6 Nations](http://www.rbs6nations.com/) in February last year.

## Kinetic and our old Social Friends

This site featured the previous kinetic timeline surfacing a mash-up of content from within [rfu.com](http://www.rfu.com) (including articles and videos) along with content from their social streams on [twitter](http://twitter.com) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com).

## New Fixtures
It also included brand new fixtures tables showing a combination of old scores and up and coming games for the tournament.

## Polish
It was great to polish up some of the loose ends from the WE ARE campaign and see this site come to life again.
