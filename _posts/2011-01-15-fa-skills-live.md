I had a great visit to the FA yesterday at Wembley to meet Mindaugas Vaiciulis and Tomasz Libich to take them through the new FA Skills codebase and architecture. The site went live a few weeks ago and is a site offering ways for parents and kids to take part in football coaching for 5 to 11 year olds.

Strangely it was my first time ever inside a football stadium and it happened to be when it was completely empty. But it's an impressive place. Apparently some of the staff have a jog around the stadium on the 5th floor at lunchtime for a bit of exercise as it's a 1 Km round trip.

It was also great to do a bit of skill sharing and to gauge how effective the architecture is to new eyes. I'm pleased to find out it was received well and may be adopted for their future projects.

Thanks to the dev guys there for making us feel welcome and I'm looking forward to keeping in touch.

For those who haven't seen the new FA Skills site take a look at [http://thefa.com/tescoskills](http://thefa.com/tescoskills).
