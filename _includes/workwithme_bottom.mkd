## Availability

I generally get booked up a **month or two in advance** so please get in touch sooner rather than
later so that we can discuss your project and timescales.

I am extremely protective of the high quality work and thought leadership I am able to 
provide my clients. To keep this high I focus on a single project at a time and am selective
about the type of offers presented to me.

I appreciate having the opportunity to work with the great companies I have done and love discovering new ones.
Get in touch and let's have a chat.

Dave has excellent technical / development skills and is very much at the cutting edge of new languages and methodologies. During his time working with ESZ Consulting he has successfully completed highly technical projects spanning from a few months to a few years! He is a valuable front end developer and an asset to any development team. Look forward to working with him again soon on the next project!”


### [Sarah Evison](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/sarah-evison/1/9a2/7a0), Managing Partner, [United Studios](http://unitedstudios.com)

“Having read the other recommendations on here I don't think there is a superlative left to describe Dave. I concur with them all. Dave is an exceptionally skilled front end developer, passionate about his work, calm in delivery and genuinely a lovely person to have on your team.

When I have a project worthy of his talent, he's first on my list!”


### [Rob Oubridge](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rob-oubridge/1/167/845), Founder, Aqueduct

“Dave is an extremely talented front-end developer - without exception the most knowledgable and advanced in his area that we have ever worked with. In addition, Dave is a cohesive team member, widely popular with his colleagues and always inspiring quality, exploration and innovation. One of the true 'greats' we've had the pleasure to work with - I cannot recommend Dave highly enough either as a professional or an individual.”


### [Guillaume Buat-Ménard](http://www.linkedin.com/in/buatmenard), Technical Director, [TMW London](http://www.tmw.co.uk)

“David is an outstanding developer combining great coding skills, broad knowledge, agency mindset for delivery and wisdom.

### [John Bown](http://www.linkedin.com/in/johnbown), Digital Operations Director, Aqueduct

“What can I say about Dave? He was a true star in the agency - no front-end site was too big or too complex for him to build. He was responsible for introducing new ways of working and for raising the bar in terms of HTML5 websites, web apps and responsive design.

Hopefully we work together again soon!”



## What team-mates are saying

### [Ian Causton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-causton-4136182/), .net CMS & CRO expert

In my experience, it’s rare to work with an individual as talented as Dave.

I had the pleasure of working with him at the BIO Agency on the Arrow Electronics account.

Although Dave’s knowledge of front end development was second to none, what really impressed me was his ability to transfer this knowledge to more junior members of the team in his role as mentor. His ceaseless drive and enthusiasm in doing this contributed hugely to a successful project and a fantastic relationship with the client and their team.

He would be a great asset for any team and I hope I will get the opportunity to work with him again in the future.

### [Suren Rajeswaren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srajeswaran/), Sitecore SME/Web Content Manager, Sage

It's my pleasure to recommend Dave. I have worked with him for a year, and he has fulfilled a number or roles in that time: Senior Front-end Developer, Tech Lead, Domain Expert and Mentor.

Dave has expert, in-depth knowledge of Front-end development including JavaScript and associated frameworks, HTML and CSS. His in-depth experience extends to he integration of the front-end into the CMS back-end, and the effects and impacts of the front-end on design (including responsive), security and performance.

He is able to provide technically robust and high-quality solutions to issues and problems rapidly and effectively, and has the architectural oversight to develop long-term strategic solutions to the implementation of website UI/UX design.

Dave is incredibly patient and is able to mentor and guide other team members in good coding practice.

Not only is Dave an invaluable member of the team, who contributed greatly to the success of the project, he is also highly respected by all his colleagues, both within the organisation and also the client business and technical teams, including senior management.

### [Ian Vaughan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianvaughan), Software Developer, [Econsultancy](https://econsultancy.com)

Dave came in and very quickly picked up tasks helping us during a large front end redesign. I think I can say anything that needed to be done, he could handle it, and it landed in our app working first time, looking good


### [Daniel Govan](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/daniel-govan/1/751/922/), Senior Interactive Web Developer, [VML London](http://london.vml.com)

I've only worked with a couple of Ninja-class developers and Dave is one of them. In addition to his mastery of the modern front-end stack he's also great at teaching and passing on the knowledge, and his his time at VML has made a lasting impression on the department. Only wish he could have stayed longer!


### [Katya Menshikova](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/katyamenshikova/), Producer at [VML London](http://london.vml.com)

Dave is an outstanding developer - proactive, fast, and adhering to best practice. Nothing fazes him; he'll take on almost any front-end development challenge and he'll do it with a smile on his face. Dave is continuously expanding his knowledge and what's more, shares it with his colleagues, which is an inspiration to see. He made a contribution to our front-end dev department that was beyond his job description and contractor role - much appreciated and admired by the rest of the team. Dave was an absolute joy to work with and I'd work with him again any day.



## What Clients are saying

### [Rakesh Thakkar](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/rakesh-thakkar/14/3a2/64a/), E-Commerce Consultant, Whitbread / Premier Inn

I had the pleasure of meeting Dave when he was assigned to one of my large scale development projects. During this time he successfully completed a multitude of development tasks. Dave communicates well and is not afraid to question the logic behind business requests. I would welcome the opportunity to work with Dave in the future, he is an asset to any team or organisation.
